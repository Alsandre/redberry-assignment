# Project Planning and Progress Tracking

This file will initially outline the plan for the project, and as I progress, I will update it to reflect the chronological order of tasks and updates.  
The project will be divided into three phases: **Planning**, **Implementing**, and **Honing**. Each phase will include task breakdowns, time estimates, and review checkpoints to help track progress and improve my project planning and time management skills.

_I am currently involved in the screening phase for a bootcamp and am excited about the opportunity to improve my skills. I have 10 days to complete the project, and I believe planning and tracking my progress will help me better understand my abilities and areas for improvement. This structured approach will not only help me meet the project deadline but also enhance my capabilities for future work._
