# Project Planning and Progress Tracking

This file will initially outline the plan for the project, and as I progress, I will update it to reflect the chronological order of tasks and updates.  
The project will be divided into three phases: **Planning**, **Implementing**, and **Honing**. Each phase will include task breakdowns, time estimates, and review checkpoints to help track progress and improve my project planning and time management skills.

_I am currently involved in the screening phase for a bootcamp and am excited about the opportunity to improve my skills. I have 10 days to complete the project, and I believe planning and tracking my progress will help me better understand my abilities and areas for improvement. This structured approach will not only help me meet the project deadline but also enhance my capabilities for future work._

# "Prologue"

_Lets call this "prologue" and keep it without mutation, I'll try to mirror phases and bullet points with updates into "main story", and ultimately I'll compare those two into "epilogue"_

# "Main story"

### 1. Planning (Day 1-2)

- [x] **Estimate time frames** (1 hour) <br>
      _fixed time, for gathering information and assessing levels of dificulties for given assignment_
- [x] **Select tech stack** (1 hour)
- [x] **Select tools** (1 hour) <br>
      _tech stack and tools selection could be combined at some point, because defining tech stack narrows down available tools, on the other hand tool might get changed over during development phase. since I had previous experience working with React and Tailwind choosing stack was not of difficult choices_
- [x] **Scaffold project** (2-3 hours) <br>
      _this step involves setting up tools and configuration files, it took more time then expected, time consumed was affected by research done for particular combination of tools_
- [x] **Create project structure** (4 hours) <br>
      _Since I changed my mind about creating project structure with boilerplate code for given files, time required greately decreased, furthermore I feel like there is no point try to figure out final looks of the project structure with assignment of given difficulty, as a result I've setup basic structure and it took approximately 2 hours'_
- [x] **Review and adjust planning** (Day 2, 1-2 hours) <br>
      _approximate time estimate 10-12 hours was required, considering soft/non-technical researches made, monitoring Q&A in discord channel and getting familiar with assignment it took about 15 huors_
      _**Review**: Despite researches done and time spent, I think that some technical modifications will be required, in general feeling organised feels good and despite the fact that time estimates are approximate and due to my inexperience I could be missing a lot it feels better to have a roadmap anyway, something to follow in order, thinking step at a time._

# "Epilogue"

---

The task has been submitted, that was trully remarkable journey. I have learnt a lot about technologies, about importance of planning, about resource management valuability, and most importantly about myself. To be honest at the last moment of the deadline, before I have checked other participants submissions, I had a feeling that I have done some GOOD job in terms of technical aspect of the project, I had feeling as if my knowledge, use of tools and technologies would be more then sufficient for given task. But the bite that looked so sweat for a glimpce turned out to be bitter, I have checked what other participants submitted and I feel like I am average? I wish I was about or little above average. Maybe this sounds strange but this gives me some kind of motivation and at the same time makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. And all of this, I am almost sure is due to my incompetence. I always felt there was vast sea outside of my buble but not to mention fear of popping my baloon I was not ready to take a proper look. Now my self esteem is trying to find its place, I took a glimpse of what could be waiting for me outside of this little baloon and I am more then excited to take it all on myself, let it blow my incompetence away!

#### Technical side of review:
I was sure of two things as the technical assignment review was about to finish: First I would use @alsandre/responsive-image-carousel and second I would use React Hook Form. First is obvious I guess, it is my first ever package and it fits task requirements. second was more challenging myself, I now there exist Low Code methodology among developers and open source community is huge support for this approach, as it provide so much ready to use code and lets developers focus on aspects of projects that are more crucial, important. I have never been against this approach, eventually I've came to conclusion that it all boils down to Low Code whenever it is possible. But it is not so easy as it sounds, since someone has already writtent something that conceptually looks alike what you are looking for does not necessarily mean that you take that code and put inside your project and "VUALA!" everything works, actually it is nothing like that for several reasons but I'll take just few. First to implement foreign code into your codebase you have to know your codebase very well, and you have to understand how provided code works. Of course implementations of modules and packages are being honed day by day and they are easier and easier to implement, but all of it is possible due to tremendous amount of work and contribution on package side and providing user friendly documantation, API and support. Anyways understanding abstracted away mechanisms of desired ready to use code is at least at some point mandatory. To make it shorter I had never ever used RHF before and I knew it would be challenging to implement it into my codebase since provided library is not one of small packages with few options, but it provides quite an ecosystem with handfull of features and tools. different approaches for different situations and so on... In the end challenge accepted! and as conclusion I could say once again that I've learnt a lot.<br>

_Note: during call, Elene had highlighted RHF while explaining that we could use any technology. To be honest I mistook that highlight as a hint to challenge myself. Later, after finishing task, when I replayed video of the call I noticed that Elene mentions RHF as one of tools that makes completion of the task easier, and I was like: out of words... Anyways I've learnt a lot._

My decision to plan out the task and chunk down the problem was correct choice. Planning help me to maintain phase and keep myself on right track. When tackling new challenges I always try to plan it out but, rarely in written form and never so detailed, that also was my first experience and I've learnt how important pre phase of technical task is. Even though I had to make some adjastments and available time was less then I hoped for, due to personal reasons, and quality of reviewing and technically following my plan was not so good, I have gained some insights and I am thankful for that.

Overall, that was interesting opportunity, and I wish to be part of the team that creates such a beautifull possibilities for enthusiastic people.

_**SELF-NOTE**_=========================
  _I need to filter out whats left and what needs to be done_
  - [x] icons imported in project
  - [x] error/success states for components
  - [x] component states on interactions
  - [x] double check data flow in all directions (update/clear/apply filters, CRUD operations) 
  - [x] format texts to match design requirements 
  - [x] implement data persistence 
  - [x] overall layout meets design requirements
