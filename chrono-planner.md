# Project Planning and Progress Tracking

This file will initially outline the plan for the project, and as I progress, I will update it to reflect the chronological order of tasks and updates.  
The project will be divided into three phases: **Planning**, **Implementing**, and **Honing**. Each phase will include task breakdowns, time estimates, and review checkpoints to help track progress and improve my project planning and time management skills.

_I am currently involved in the screening phase for a bootcamp and am excited about the opportunity to improve my skills. I have 10 days to complete the project, and I believe planning and tracking my progress will help me better understand my abilities and areas for improvement. This structured approach will not only help me meet the project deadline but also enhance my capabilities for future work._

# "Prologue"

_Lets call this "prologue" and keep it without mutation, I'll try to mirror phases and bullet points with updates into "main story", and ultimately I'll compare those two into "epilogue"_

## Project Phases

### 1. Planning (Day 1-2)

- **Estimate time frames** (1 hour)
- **Select tech stack** (1 hour)
- **Select tools** (1 hour)
- **Scaffold project** (2-3 hours)
- **Create project structure** (4 hours)
- **Review and adjust planning** (Day 2, 1-2 hours)

### 2. Implementing (Day 3-7)

#### Page 1: Real Estate Listings (Day 3-4)

- **Implement components logic** for listing cards (4 hours)
  - Picture, address, city, zip code, price, area, bedrooms, rent/sale tag
- **Wire up data** using the provided backend (3-4 hours)
- **Implement filters** for price, area, region, and bedrooms (5 hours)
  - Single or multiple criteria support
  - Handle min > max validation for price/area ranges
- **Review progress & make adjustments** (Day 4, 1-2 hours)

#### Page 2: Estate Details Page (Day 5)

- **Render detailed estate information** (5-6 hours)
  - Picture, address, city, zip code, price, area, bedrooms, rent/sale tag, description, publish date, agent info (picture, name, email, mobile)
- **Implement infinite slider** for estates in the same region (4-5 hours)
- **Wire up data logic** for the estate details (3-4 hours)
- **Add delete functionality** with modal confirmation and redirect (3-4 hours)
- **Review & adjust work done** (Day 5, 1 hour)

#### Page 3: Add Estate & Modal for New Agent (Day 6-7)

- **Implement "Add New Estate" form** with address, picture, region, city, zip, price, area, bedrooms, description, sale/rent, agent dropdown (5-6 hours)
- **Implement "Add New Agent" modal** with name, surname, email, picture, mobile fields (4 hours)
- **Wire up both forms to backend** (4 hours)
- **Ensure data persistence** after refresh across all pages (3 hours)
- **Review entire implementation** (Day 7, 2-3 hours)

### 3. Honing (Day 8-10)

- **Fine-tune UI/UX and performance** (Day 8-9, 6-8 hours)
- **Ensure responsiveness and compatibility** (Day 9, 3-4 hours, optional as responsiveness is not required)
- **Final review, bug fixes, and polish** (Day 10, 5-6 hours)
- **Conclusion and reflections** (Day 10, 2 hours)

# "Main story"

### 1. Planning (Day 1-2)

- [x] **Estimate time frames** (1 hour) <br>
      _fixed time, for gathering information and assessing levels of dificulties for given assignment_
- [x] **Select tech stack** (1 hour)
- [x] **Select tools** (1 hour) <br>
      _tech stack and tools selection could be combined at some point, because defining tech stack narrows down available tools, on the other hand tool might get changed over during development phase. since I had previous experience working with React and Tailwind choosing stack was not of difficult choices_
- [x] **Scaffold project** (2-3 hours) <br>
      _this step involves setting up tools and configuration files, it took more time then expected, time consumed was affected by research done for particular combination of tools_
- [x] **Create project structure** (4 hours) <br>
      _Since I changed my mind about creating project structure with boilerplate code for given files, time required greately decreased, furthermore I feel like there is no point try to figure out final looks of the project structure with assignment of given difficulty, as a result I've setup basic structure and it took approximately 2 hours'_
- **Review and adjust planning** (Day 2, 1-2 hours)
