# Project Planning and Progress Tracking

This file will initially outline the plan for the project, and as I progress, I will update it to reflect the chronological order of tasks and updates.  
The project will be divided into three phases: **Planning**, **Implementing**, and **Honing**. Each phase will include task breakdowns, time estimates, and review checkpoints to help track progress and improve my project planning and time management skills.

_I am currently involved in the screening phase for a bootcamp and am excited about the opportunity to improve my skills. I have 10 days to complete the project, and I believe planning and tracking my progress will help me better understand my abilities and areas for improvement. This structured approach will not only help me meet the project deadline but also enhance my capabilities for future work._

# "Prologue"

_Lets call this "prologue" and keep it without mutation, I'll try to mirror phases and bullet points with updates into "main story", and ultimately I'll compare those two into "epilogue"_

# "Main story"

### 1. Planning (Day 1-2)

- [x] **Estimate time frames** (1 hour) <br>
      _fixed time, for gathering information and assessing levels of dificulties for given assignment_
- [x] **Select tech stack** (1 hour)
- [x] **Select tools** (1 hour) <br>
      _tech stack and tools selection could be combined at some point, because defining tech stack narrows down available tools, on the other hand tool might get changed over during development phase. since I had previous experience working with React and Tailwind choosing stack was not of difficult choices_
- [x] **Scaffold project** (2-3 hours) <br>
      _this step involves setting up tools and configuration files, it took more time then expected, time consumed was affected by research done for particular combination of tools_
- [x] **Create project structure** (4 hours) <br>
      _Since I changed my mind about creating project structure with boilerplate code for given files, time required greately decreased, furthermore I feel like there is no point try to figure out final looks of the project structure with assignment of given difficulty, as a result I've setup basic structure and it took approximately 2 hours'_
- [x] **Review and adjust planning** (Day 2, 1-2 hours) <br>
      _approximate time estimate 10-12 hours was required, considering soft/non-technical researches made, monitoring Q&A in discord channel and getting familiar with assignment it took about 15 huors_
      _**Review**: Despite researches done and time spent, I think that some technical modifications will be required, in general feeling organised feels good and despite the fact that time estimates are approximate and due to my inexperience I could be missing a lot it feels better to have a roadmap anyway, something to follow in order, thinking step at a time._
